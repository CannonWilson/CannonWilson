## Hi there! My name is Cannon Wilson. 

I am a mixed reality (MR) enthusiast seeking a master's degree in computer science. This is a new GitHub account I made to show those programs some of the work I've done in the past.

My goal is to create immersive mixed reality experiences that make exercise fun.

I have completed three projects for my Oculus Quest 2, including: VR meditation, AR basketball, and AR obstacle courses. I am also involved with a volunteer project creating an engaging game to teach English to kids and refugees, as well as a side-project to build a website that shows off local artists and galleries in the Amarillo area.

Please send me an email at CannonGWilson@gmail.com if you are interested in collaborating!
