## Hi there! My name is Cannon Wilson. 

I am a virtual reality (VR)/mixed reality (MR)/augmented reality (AR) enthusiast seeking a master's degree in computer science. This is a new GitHub account I made to show off some of the work I've done in the past.

This is just a taste of the projects I've made, so check out my other repos if you're interested. If you haven't yet, check out CannonWilson.com for a visual introduction to who I am. Please send me an email at CannonGWilson@gmail.com if you are interested in collaborating!
