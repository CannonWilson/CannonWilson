## Hi there! My name is Cannon Wilson. 

##### I am an AR/VR enthusiast seeking a master's degree in computer science. My goal is to create immersive mixed reality experiences that make exercise fun. I am also interested in using machine learning for gesture recognition in order to give those experiences incredibly natural and intuitive controls.

##### I have completed three AR/VR projects for my Oculus Quest 2, including: VR meditation, AR basketball, and AR obstacle courses. I have completed two mobile projects for my iPhone, including: hand pose recognition using ML and a PDF viewer with swipe action controls. Finally, I am involved with a volunteer project to create engaging games to teach English to kids.

##### Please send me an email at CannonGWilson@gmail.com if you are interested in collaborating!
