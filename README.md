## Hi there! 

My name is Cannon Wilson. I am a computer science master's student at UW-Madison. I've got a bit of exposure to lots of different areas of computer science so I'm familiar with these areas:

- Web Development (HTL/CSS/JS, MongoDB, SQL, Express, Node, Flask, React, Redux)
- Introductory iOS Development (XCode, Swift, SwiftUI, RealityKit)
- Data Science (Matplotlib, Pandas)
- AI (PyTorch, Resnet, SVMs, GMMs, Prompt Engineering for LLMs, CLIP, MTCNN)
- Unity Development (Unity 2021.3.24, Oculus Integration Toolkit)
- High Performance Computing (C++, OpenMP, CUDA, OpenMPI)

Here are a couple cool projects I've done:

OpenMP and CUDA Particle Simulation with VR Viewing:

This is just a taste of the projects I've made, so check out my other repos if you're interested. Please send me an email at CannonGWilson@gmail.com if you have any questions~
